## User Experience (UX)


  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the company.
        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. I want to look for the services and prices. 
        4. I also want to locate  social media links to see how trusted and known this company.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. I want to find information to contact with the company easily for the services .
        2. I want to find their detailed services and prices.

 
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The  main colours used classic for industry  (#e84610 , #525252).
  - #### Typography
    - The Roboto  font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto  is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

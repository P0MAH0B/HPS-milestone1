## Introduction

[View the live project here.](https://p0mah0b.github.io/HPS-milestone1/)

This is the  project for Full Stack Software Developement course. I decided to make website for my business because it will help me get more clients in my existing career. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential visitors and customers.

  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

 - Responsive on all devices sizes
 - Navigation bar is placed on the top left of the screen and is clear and easy to use. This is also placed in the same position on every page.
 - Footer at the bottom of each page that links to the social media websites.
 - All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

##  Skeleton
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.
 
### Wireframes

  - Large screen Wireframe - [About page](/images/about-web.png), [Services Page](/images/serv-web.png)

I used GitHub pages to deploy my final project. To do this I had to:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor using the clone link.
4. Add files to Git (staging area) and use the commit to master button.
5. Use git  to push the code.
7. Go to GitHub and load your repository.
8. Select settings.
9. Select pages on the left menu bar.
10. Click on the master branch.
11. This will now generate a link with your website live.
